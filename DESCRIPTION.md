## ComfyUI Together Vision Node

A custom ComfyUI node that leverages Together AI's Vision models to generate detailed descriptions of images. This node integrates both paid (Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) and free (Llama-Vision-Free) models, allowing users to get high-quality image descriptions directly within their ComfyUI workflows.

### Key Features
- 🎯 Easy-to-use image description node for ComfyUI
- 🔄 Support for both paid and free Together AI Vision models
- 🎚️ Advanced parameter controls (temperature, top_p, top_k, repetition_penalty)
- 🔑 Flexible API key management (via node input or .env file)
- 📝 Customizable system and user prompts
- 🛠️ Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Quick Start
1. Install the node in your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory
2. Add your Together AI API key
3. Connect any image output to the node
4. Get detailed, AI-generated descriptions of your images

Perfect for:
